      The 2023 Indian Premier League final was played on 29 May 2023 at the
      Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. It was a Day/Night T20 match that
      would decide the winner of the 2023 season of the Indian Premier League
      (IPL), an annual Twenty20 tournament in India. The match was originally
      scheduled to be played on 28 May, but was postponed to 29 May due to
      rain—marking the first time the IPL final had been postponed due to
      weather. After winning the toss, Chennai Super Kings elected to field,
      with Gujarat Titans scoring 214 runs for 4 wickets, setting the record for
      the highest team total in an IPL final.[1] Due to inclement weather, the
      Super Kings' innings was delayed by over an hour, and the target was
      adjusted by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) method to 171 runs in 15
      overs; the team would ultimately win by five wickets, securing their fifth
      IPL title. CSK player Devon Conway was named player of the match.[2][3]
      The broadcasts of the match on JioCinema peaked at over 32 million
      concurrent viewers, overtaking the 2019 Cricket World Cup semi-final
      between India and New Zealand on Hotstar[4] as India's most-watched
      livestreaming broadcast of all time.[5]
