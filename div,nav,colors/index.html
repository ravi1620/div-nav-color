        The 2023 Indian Premier League final was played on 29 May 2023 at the
        Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. It was a Day/Night T20 match that
        would decide the winner of the 2023 season of the Indian Premier League
        (IPL), an annual Twenty20 tournament in India. The match was originally
        scheduled to be played on 28 May, but was postponed to 29 May due to
        rain—marking the first time the IPL final had been postponed due to
        weather. After winning the toss, Chennai Super Kings elected to field,
        with Gujarat Titans scoring 214 runs for 4 wickets, setting the record
        for the highest team total in an IPL final.[1] Due to inclement weather,
        the Super Kings' innings was delayed by over an hour, and the target was
        adjusted by the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern (DLS) method to 171 runs in 15
        overs; the team would ultimately win by five wickets, securing their
        fifth IPL title. CSK player Devon Conway was named player of the
        match.[2][3] The broadcasts of the match on JioCinema peaked at over 32
        million concurrent viewers, overtaking the 2019 Cricket World Cup
        semi-final between India and New Zealand on Hotstar[4] as India's
        most-watched livestreaming broadcast of all time.[5]
